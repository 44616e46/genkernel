NAME
----
genkernel - the Gentoo Linux automatic kernel compiler.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*genkernel* [options...] action


INTRODUCTION
------------
Genkernel is designed to allow users who are not previously used to
compiling a kernel to use a similar setup to that one that is used on
the Gentoo LiveCDs which auto-detects your hardware.

Some users may also be interested in using genkernel for hardware which
requires initialization and a working kernel before it can be booted
because genkernel also automatically compiles your kernel modules,
allowing hardware which needs to be loaded with module parameters to be
used.


USAGE
-----
All that is needed to run genkernel is just `genkernel` with an
action and any flags you might need:

------------------------------------------
# genkernel --menuconfig --no-clean --no-install all
------------------------------------------

This would produce a kernel, asking you what how to configure it to
your desire, leaving alone any existing compiled object files, but not
installing anything.


ACTIONS
-------
An action tells genkernel what you want it to do  -  the following
actions are supported:

*all*::
    Build all steps - the kernel, modules, and the ramdisk.
*bzImage*::
    Build only the kernel.
*kernel*::
    Build only the kernel and the modules.
*initramfs*::
    Build only the ramdisk.


OPTIONS
-------
Genkernel supports the following options which alter its behaviour.
Certain options have *--no-* variants which do the opposite thing.
You can specify your options in any order.


DEBUGGING OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--loglevel*=<0-5>::
    This controls the out verbosity level of genkernel output - if
    this is set to 0, minimal debugging is done; if this is set to 5
    as much output as possible is given.

*--logfile*=<outfile>::
    This outputs debugging data to the file <outfile>. By default
    this is '/var/log/genkernel.log'.

*--*[*no-*]*color*::
    Turns on, or off, output in color using escape sequences.


KERNEL CONFIGURATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--*[*no-*]*menuconfig*::
    Runs, or does not run "make menuconfig" after running "make oldconfig".

*--*[*no-*]*save-config*::
    Saves, or does not save the kernel configuration to '/etc/kernels'
    if the kernel is successfully compiled.

*--gconfig*::
    Run "make gconfig" after "make oldconfig".

*--xconfig*::
    Run "make xconfig" after "make oldconfig".


KERNEL COMPILATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--*[*no-*]*clean*::
    Runs, or does not run, "make clean" before compilation  -  this
    erases any compiled object files in the kernel source tree but
    does not have an impact on the kernel configuration.  Specifying
    *--no-clean* implies *--no-mrproper*.

*--*[*no-*]*mrproper*::
    Runs, or does not run, "make mrproper" before compilation - this
    erases both any compiled object files in the kernel source tree
    as well as the kernel configuration.

*--*[*no-*]*install*::
    Installs,  or does not install the kernel to '/boot' after building.
    The default is  *--install*.   If MOUNTBOOT is set in
    '/etc/genkernel.conf'  then '/boot' will be automatically mounted if
    it is not already mounted before the ramdisk and kernel images
    are copied over.

*--*[*no-*]*symlink*::
    Manages,  or does not manage, symlinks in '/boot' like the manual
    kernel "make install" process does. A kernel (or,  depending on
    options,  kernelz)  symlink will link to the most recently built
    kernel image and a kernel.old (or kernelz.old) symlink will link
    to the second most recently built image, if one exists.  Similar
    symlinks (both * and *.old) are managed for initramfs and System.map.
    The corresponding work products (i.e., the actual kernel
    and initamfs images, and System.map) are also managed accordingly.
    NOTE: Specifying   *--symlink*  does nothing unless
    *--install* is also specified.

*--no-ramdisk-modules*::
    Don't copy any modules to the ramdisk.

*--oldconfig*::
    Implies *--no-clean*, and thus *--no-mrproper*, running a "make oldconfig".

*--callback*=<...>::
    Run the specified arguments in the current environment after the
    kernel and modules have been compiled.


KERNEL LOCATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--kerneldir*=<dir>::
    This specifies the location of the kernel sources;  the default
    is '/usr/src/linux'.

*--kernel-config*=<file>::
    This specifies a kernel configuration file to use for compilation;
    by default genkernel uses the config from the previous
    build of the same kernel version or a default kernel config if
    there isn't a previous config.


LOW-LEVEL COMPILATION OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--kernel-cc*=<compiler>::
    Compiler to use for the kernel compilation (e.g. distcc).

*--kernel-as*=<assembler>::
    Assembler to use for the kernel compilation.

*--kernel-ld*=<linker>::
    Linker to use for the kernel compilation.

*--kernel-make*=<makeprg>::
    GNU Make to use for the kernel compilation.

*--utils-cc*=<compiler>::
    Compiler to use for utilities.

*--utils-as*=<assembler>::
    Assembler to use for utilities.

*--utils-ld*=<linker>::
    Linker to use for utilities.

*--utils-make*=<makeprog>::
    GNU Make to use for utilities.

*--makeopts*=<makeopts>::
    GNU Make options such as -j2, etc.


INITIALIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--*[*no-*]*splash*=<theme>::
    If the extra argument is specified,  splash is forced using
    <theme>  rather than the default theme specified in your splash
    configuration. If *--no-splash* is specified, then splash is disabled.

*--splash-res*=<resolutions>::
    Optionally select splash resolutions to include.

*--do-keymap-auto*::
    Force keymap selection at boot.

*--dmraid*::
    Add DMRAID support.

*--evms*::
    Add in EVMS support from static binaries if they exist on the
    system: you should run "emerge evms" first.

*--lvm*::
    Add in LVM support from static binaries if they exist on the
    system,  or compile static LVM binaries if static ones do not
    exist.

*--luks*::
    Add in Luks support from static binaries if they exist on the
    system.

*--static*::
    This builds a monolithic kernel without any modules on any
    initial ramdisks.

*--linuxrc*=<file>::
    Use <file> for the linuxrc instead of the genkernel linuxrc.


INTERNALS
~~~~~~~~~
*--arch-override*=<arch>::
    Force the architecture settings described by the <arch>  profile
    instead of autodetecting the running architecture.

*--tempdir*=<dir>::
    Sets genkernel's temporary working directory to <dir>.


OUTPUT SETTINGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--kernname*=<...>::
    Tag the kernel and initrd with a name, if not defined this
    option defaults to genkernel

*--minkernpackage*=<tbz2>::
    File to output a .tar.bz2'd kernel and initrd: no modules outside
    of the initrd will be included...

*--modulespackage*=<tbz2>::
    File to output a .tar.bz2'd modules after the callbacks have run

*--kerncache*=<tbz2>::
    File to output a .tar.bz2'd kernel, contents of '/lib/modules/'
    and the kernel config.  NOTE: This is created before the callbacks
    are run.

*--no-kernel-sources*=<tbz2>::
    This option is only valid if kerncache is defined If there is a
    valid kerncache no checks will be made against a kernel source
    tree.

*--initramfs-overlay*=<dir>::
    Directory structure to include in the initramfs, only available
    on 2.6 kernels


RAMDISK OPTIONS
---------------
The following options can be passed as kernel parameters from the bootloader,
which the ramdisk scripts would recognize.

*real_root*=<...>::
    Specifies the device node of the root filesystem to mount.

*crypt_root*=<...>::
    This specifies the device encrypted by Luks, which contains the
    root filesystem to mount.

*crypt_swap*=<...>::
    This specifies the swap device encrypted by Luks.

*root_key*=<...>::
    In case your root is encrypted with a key, you can use a device
    like a  usb pen to store the key.  This value should be the key
    path relative to the mount point.

*root_keydev*=<...>::
    If necessary provide the name of the device that carries the
    root_key.   If unset while using root_key, it will automatically
    look for the device in every boot.

*swap_key*=<...>::
    Same as root_key for swap.

*swap_keydev*=<...>::
    Same as root_keydev for swap.

*crypt_silent*::
    Set this to silent all the output related to the cryptographic
    software,  and in case your encrypted device isn't open with the
    key, it opens a shell in the initrd quietly.

*dodmraid*=<...>::
    Passes arguments to dmraid on bootup.

*real_init*=<...>::
    Passes arguments to init on bootup.

*scandelay*=<...>::
    Pauses for 10 seconds before running devfsd if no argument is
    specified; otherwise pauses for the number of specified seconds.

*ip*=<...>::
    Normally used to tell the kernel that it should start a network
    interface. If present, the initrd will try to mount a  livecd
    over NFS.

*nfsroot*=<...>::
    If present,  the initrd will try to mount a livecd from that
    location. Otherwise the location will be deduced from the DCHP
    request (option root-path)

*doevms*::
    Activate EVMS volumes on bootup

*dolvm*::
    Activate LVM volumes on bootup

*doscsi*::
    Activate SCSI devices on bootup, necessary when SCSI support is
    compiled as modules and you're using SCSI or SATA devices.


NETBOOTING
----------
The initrd scripts have limited support for network booting.   This is
activated if the *ip*=<...> kernel parameter was given. Please refer to
the genkernel guide at 'http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/genkernel.xml' for
more information.

The initrd scripts will extract any *.tar.gz files found in the '/add'
directory of the livecd into the root filesystem during boot. This way
it is easy to extend a netbooted LiveCD i.e. add custom tools, or other
kernel modules.


REPORTING BUGS
--------------
If you believe you have found a bug in the genkernel scripts,  then
please file a bug on the Gentoo Linux Bugzilla: 'http://bugs.gentoo.org',
assigning your bug to genkernel@gentoo.org. We cannot assist you with
kernel compilation failures unless they are caused by a genkernel bug.

Kernel issues for Gentoo-supported kernels, including compilation failures
should go to 'http://bugs.gentoo.org' and should be assigned to kernel@gentoo.org.
Please check if an existing bug documents the same
issue before opening a new bug. Issues for kernel sources not supported
by Gentoo should go to their relevant authors.
