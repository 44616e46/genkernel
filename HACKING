This document is a work-in-progress to describe the workflow through the various
parts of genkernel so that we can split the code into modular chunks.  If you
are interested in helping with genkernel development, contact Chris Gianelloni
at wolf31o2@wolf31o2.org for access.

Phases:

- read configs
- source global scripts
- 

Rolling a release:
- Bump the version in the main genkernel file.
- echangelog commit the bump
- git tag -a -m "Tag release $PV" v${PV}
- git archive --prefix genkernel-$PV/ --format tar -o /tmp/genkernel-${PV}.tar v${PV}
- bzip2 -9v /tmp/genkernel-${PV}.tar
- upload /tmp/genkernel-${PV}.tar.bz2 to the hosting.
